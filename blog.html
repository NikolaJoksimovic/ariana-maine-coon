            Maine Coon cats eat a combination of meat like chicken and fish, dry
            cat food, and wet cat food. Main Coons are large and energetic, so
            they need plenty of protein to fuel their play. While they don’t
            need a specialized diet per se, they need to consume raw or cooked
            meat. While these cats can get all of their dietary needs through
            dry and wet cat food, some owners opt for a raw food diet combined
            with supplements. Stick with high-protein, low-fat meat like
            poultry, fish, and rabbit. The best raw food diet for Maine Coon
            cats contains 85% muscle meat, organs, and ground bones. If you
            choose this diet for your cat, consider adding vitamins and
            supplements to keep your cat healthy. Veterinary studies confirmed
            that omega-3 fatty acid supplements help treat inflammatory bowel
            disease in Maine Coons. Also, don’t forget the cat treats!
